❓ Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Why does Windows say the app is "Unrecognized"? A: Since this is an independent open-source tool, it isn't "signed" by Microsoft. Click More Info then Run Anyway to proceed.

Q: Does the app see my Tapo Password? A: Your credentials stay on your computer. They are stored locally in your Windows AppData folder to authenticate with the TP-Link local API.

Q: My lights aren't responding! A: Make sure your PC and the light strip are on the same 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. Also, double-check that the IP address in the app matches the one in your Tapo Mobile App.
